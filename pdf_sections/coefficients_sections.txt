Table F-3 from McKenna et al. 1996. The release fraction for ruthenium was changed from the value of
a
0.01 in NUREG- 1140 to a value of 0.1. NUREG- 1140 assumed that ruthenium was nonvolatile (McGuire
1988). However, research in NUREG/CR-6218 (Power, Kmetyk, and Schmidt 1994) indicates (in Table 5)
that at high temperatures ruthenium starts to become volatile. The ruthenium release fraction of 0.1 is less
than the value of 0.5 used in NUREG- 1140 for compounds because ruthenium is less volatile than other
volatile compounds, becoming highly volatile only at temperatures not normally reached in building fires.
The carbon release fraction is appropriate for carbon compounds other than CO,. Those compounds deliver
most of the dose. The dose conversion factors used for carbon are for those carbon compounds.
b If the specific physical form of the nuclide is known, Table 2.1 may be used.
c The fire release fraction is the fraction of the isotope released when the material is involved in a fire, and
equals the total activity released (Ci), users should divide by the activity involved in fire (Ci).
Fire release fractions are element specific. The fire reduction factors are shown in Tables 3.1 land 3.12
and are from NUREG- 1140 (McGuire 1988).

activity distribution. The use of the semi-infinite cloud model is usually inappropriate in the immediate
vicinity of the release point, and application of the MESORAD finite-plume model to cloudshine dose
estimates near the release point did not prove satisfactory. Consequently, two additional cloudshine dose
model have been developed and are used in RASCAL 3.0.5.
The new cloudshine models are based on line sources and plane sources and are analogous to the point-
source model. These models are used, along with the point-source model, until plumes and puffs grow to
sufficient size that the assumptions associated with the semi-infinite cloud model are met. The finite-
plume, cloudshine models in RASCAL 3.0.5 make use of precalculated dose rate vs distance curves.
These curves are provided in the radionuclide database for each radionuclide for a I Ci (0.01 Sv) point
source, and a I Ci/m (0.01 Sv/m) infinite-line source. The remainder of this section describes the
cloudshine models.
4.9.3.1 Puff Model Cloudshine Dose Calculations
There are three stages in the cloudshine dose calculations. Near the source where puff dimensions are
small compared to the mean path length of photons, RASCAL uses a point-kernel dose model. When the
puff radius becomes sufficient (oy=400 m), cloud-shine dose rates beneath the centerline of the plume are
calculated using an infinite-slab model. The dose rate at ground level is calculated assuming that the
activity in the plume is equally divided among ten horizontal slabs with slab heights determined by the
release height and vertical dispersion coefficients. The change in dose rate with distance from slabs is due
only to buildup and absorption of photons; the change in dose rate across the plume is proportional to the
crosswind variation of activity concentration in the slab. This model will be discussed further. Finally,
when the vertical dimensions of the plume become sufficient (a,=400 m), cloudshine is calculated using a
semi-infinite cloud model.
The initial versions of RASCAL used the MESORAD finite-puff, cloudshine model (Scherpelz et al.
1986, Ramsdell et al. 1988). This model first calculates composite characteristics (photon energies,
photons per disintegration, etc.) of the gamma radiation from the radionuclide mix in a puff. Next, the
model calculates the dose rate vs distance from a point source having the composite characteristics using
Up (p) 2.13x 106 1,[f, B,(JP)e-,o"PE TW] (4.40)
44 n( p 2
where
Dp '(p) = dose rate in (rem/h)/Ci,
p = distance from point source,
fy = fraction of disintegrations producing ys of energy, E,,
By(u.,p) = buildup factor for air,
/Iay = linear attenuation factor for air,
EY= gamma energy,
T= mass energy absorption coefficient for tissue (n,1p,),
t
WY= ratio of whole body dose to surface dose.
The constant 2.13 x 106 is a collection of unit conversion constants to give dose rate in (rem/h)/Ci. The
components of the constant are described following Eq. 19 in Scherpelz, et al. (1986).

RASCAL 3.0.5 can provide a more realistic estimate of the doses that people would actually receive, but
that requires some effort. To account for evacuation, the end of calculation time can be set to the time at
which people evacuate. The TEDE then is the sum of the inhalation dose, cloudshine dose, and period
ground shine dose. If sheltering prior to evacuation is to be taken into account, each dose component must
be reduced by an appropriate reduction factor for sheltering before the three dose components are
summed.
4.9.6 Total Acute Bone Dose Equivalent
Total acute bone dose equivalent is another multiple pathway dose calculated in RASCAL 3.0.5. The total
acute bone dose equivalent is the sum of the cloudshine dose, the ground shine dose, and a 4-day
inhalation dose to bone red marrow.

where
Dg/(T) = groundshine dose (rem) for occupancy time interval T,
GRF = ground roughness factor with a default value of 0.82 (dimensionless),
Cgi = initial (t = 0) ground surface concentration (Ci/m2) of radionuclide i,
DCPgsi(T)= intermediate phase groundshine dose conversion parameter [rem/(Ci/m 2)] for
radionuclide i and occupancy time interval T.
The occupancy time intervals T over which groundshine dose Dg,(T) is calculated correspond to the time
intervals for the intermediate phase in the EPA Protective Action Guide manual, specifically, for the case
of no reentry delay: zero to one year, one year to two years, and zero to 50 years. If the RASCAL user
specifies a reentry delay, the occupancy time interval then starts at the specified time of reentry.
In previous versions of RASCAL, the ground roughness factor GRF was 0.7. However, more recent
measurements (Anspaugh et al. 2002), based in large part on Chernobyl data, suggest that 0.82 is a more
realistic value. FRMAC has also recently adopted a GRF of 0.82.
The intermediate phase groundshine dose conversion parameters DCPgSi(T) are calculated as:
N
n=O
where
Eegn(T) = effective time of exposure to the parent nuclide (n = 0) or daughter (n 2!1 ) for occupancy
time interval T accounting for decay, ingrowth, and weathering [s]
EDCý = effective dose rate coefficient for exposure to contaminated ground surface based on Table
111.3 of FGR 12 [Rem / (Ci s M2)]
The summation from n = 0 to n = N is over the parent and all daughters.
The effective dose rate coefficient for exposure to contaminated ground surface EDCn is equal to the
effective dose rate coefficient in Federal Guidance Report (FGR) No. 12 (Eckerman and Ryman 1993)
except when a nuclide has a short-lived daughter. For about 40 radionuclides with short-lived daughters,
the parent-daughter combination is treated as a single nuclide with the parent's half-life. The effective
dose rate coefficients EDC, assigned to the combination of the parent and implicit daughter is the sum of
the parent's effective dose rate coefficient from FGR 12 plus the daughter's effective dose rate coefficient
(corrected for branching ratio). The treatment of these combinations of parent plus implicit daughter is
discussed in more detail in Section 7.2.
The intermediate phase effective exposure duration Eegn(T) is for a specific exposure interval T and
accounts for the radiological decay of the parent radionuclide and the ingrowth and decay of daughter
radionuclides on the ground during the interval. It also accounts for weathering during the exposure
interval.
7-2

--- PAGE 139 ---

The groundshine effective exposure duration Eegn(T) for each radionuclide n is
Eeg,(T) = Ao-' JoA(t)W,(t)dt (7.3)
where
Ao = initial activity of the parent (Ci)
An(t) activity of the radionuclide n (Ci)
=
W,(t) = groundshine weathering function (dimensionless)
The activity of the parent radionuclide as a function of time is given by the usual exponential relationship
A(t) = Ao exp(- b) (7.4)
where
Ao = initial activity, and
, = decay constant (s').
Activities for daughters are given by the Bateman equations (Benedict et al. 1987) modified to be
appropriate for activity rather than atoms (Strenge 1997) and to include branching fractions. These
equations are described in Section 7.2.
The groundshine weathering function W,(t) (Anspaugh et al. 2002), based in large part on Chernobyl data,
is a sum of two exponential terms
WsV(t)= Cle-a + C e-Pt (7.5)
2
where
t = the time after deposition in days.
The first term describes the weathering during the first few years after deposition and the second term
describes long term weathering. The values of C, and C2 are 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, and the values of a
andf are 1.26x 10- d', and 3.8x 10-5 d', respectively. FRMAC has also recently adopted this weathering
function.
When Equations (7.4) and (7.5) are substituted into Equation (7.3), the resulting integral can be solved in
closed form. Equation (7.3) can also be integrated for daughters. These solutions, which are not shown
here, are used in intermediate phase groundshine dose calculations.

Vb = breathing rate (m3/s),
R= initial resuspension factor (rn')
Cgj= ground surface concentration (Ci/m2) of radionuclide i
DCPinh A(T) = inhalation intermediate phase dose conversion parameter [rem-s/Ci].
The default breathing rate Vb is 2.67x 10.4 m3/s, which represents a long term breathing rate that includes
both waking and sleeping breathing rates.
The inhalation intermediate phase dose conversion parameter DCFihi(T)i ncludes decay and ingrowth and
the time-dependent (Weathering) portion of the resuspension function.
For inhalation, the intermediate phase dose conversion parameters include decay, ingrowth, and
resuspension. These dose conversion parameters are calculated as
where
N
DCPfhi (T) = -[Eea.(T) x ECF] (7.9)
n=O
DCPifh,(T)= intermediate phase dose conversion parameter for the parent radionuclide
Eean(T) = effective exposure duration to airborne activity of the parent nuclide (n = 0) or daughters
(nŽ 1) during T accounting for decay, ingrowth, and resuspension
ECF. = effective dose factor based on Table 2.1 in FGR 11 including implicit daughters as previously
described.
The summation is over the parent and all daughters.
The effective exposure duration to airborne activity, Eea/(T) for each radionuclide (parent and daughters)
is
Eean(T) = A,, IoA (t)R,(t)dt (7.10)
where
A/(t) = activity of the radionuclide
R,(t) = time-dependent resuspension factor
RASCAL implements the resuspension factor model in NCRP Report No. 129 (NCRP 1999). For the first
day, the initial resuspension factor is constant with a default value of 106 m'. Beyond 1,000 days, the
resuspension factor is also constant with a value of 10' m'. For days I through 1,000, the resuspension
factor R,(t) is modeled as

and
2 decay constant for the second-generation daughter.
d2 =
In the above equations, the time-dependent activities of the parent and daughters are functions of the
initial (measured) activity of the parent.
7.3 Derived Response Levels (DRLs)
A derived response level is a measurable quantity that indicates that the deposited activity could result in
an intermediate phase dose equal to one of the intermediate phase protective action guides. One type of
DRL is the closed window (gamma) dose rate in mR/hour equal to the first, second, or 50 year
intermediate phase PAG. The other DRL is the ground concentration of a marker radionuclide equivalent
to a PAG.
RASCAL computes two sets of DRLs - one set for use with measured exposure rates (meter readings), and
the other for use with measurement of the surface contamination of a marker radionuclide. In either case,
the DRLs are based on an assumed mixture of radionuclides on the surface. In RASCAL, DRLs are
computed for first year, second year, and 50 years for a range of times from 0 to 100 days since the initial
measurement.
7.3.1 Exposure Rate Derived Response Levels
The exposure rate derived response level (DRL) is the exposure rate that will occur when the ground
concentration present will cause a dose to an inhabitant that is equal to the intermediate phase protective
action guide. Thus, an exposure rate measurement survey instrument can be used to identify areas where
doses might exceed the intermediate phase protective action guides.
Exposure rate DRLs are calculated using equations developed from methods described in the FRMAC
Manual (SNL 2003). However, the RASCAL DRLs include an inadvertent ingestion component that is not
included in the FRMAC computational method. The basic equation used in RASCAL for exposure rate
DRLs is
1.429 x (C x GRFox ECFoj x 3600.)
DRLexp =PAGx (7.16)

ECFegi = exposure rate dose coefficient for contaminated soil from Table 111.3 of FGR No. 12
(Eckerman and Ryman 1993)
3600 s/hr converts the exposure rate to an hourly rate.
The occupancy time interval for the intermediate phase dose conversion parameters are usually for the
occupancy time intervals established for the EPA protective action guides for the intermediate phase.
7.3.2 Marker Nuclide Derived Response Levels
In some instances it may be difficult to use the exposure rate DRIL to identify areas where doses might
exceed the protective action guides. Examples are when the exposure rate is near background levels or
when there are no gamma-emitting radionuclides in the mix. In those instances, it may be easier to
measure the surface concentration of a particular marker radionuclide rather than the exposure rate.
The marker nuclide DRL is the concentration of that nuclide expected to cause doses to inhabitants equal
to the protective action guides. Following the method in the FRMAC Manual (SNL 2003), RASCAL
calculates marker DRLs as follows
DRLiark = PAG x Cgk
SCýj [(GRF x DCP ~+ (ING x DCFPng) + (R,,, x VXx (7.17),
where
Cgk ý ground concentration of the marker radionuclide (mCi/rn2)
As with the exposure rate DRLs, the RASCAL calculation includes an optional inadvertent ingestion
component not included in the FRMAC DRL calculation.
